<h2>Error-Model Annex v2 support in the Instance Model Viewer</h2>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
The Instance Model Viewer includes a functionality to view the errors
risen from a component and their associated propagation. To use
this functionality, you need to open the instance model in IMV.
Then, to activate the view of an error propagation from a component,
select the component that is the error source and click on the error
button on the IMV toolbar, highlighted in red in the following picture.

<p>
The component source is highlighted in light red while the
components impacted have a background color with dark red. In this
example, the <em>temperature_sensor</em> is the error source
and we see that it might impact the <em>thermostat</em> component.
</p>

<p>
The other example is shown below with the same example. Now, the error
source is the <em>thermostat</em> example, the <em>heat_source</em>
and <em>operator_interface</em> are the impacted components.

<h3>Known limitations</h3>
<p>
While being a prototype, the tool has the following limitations:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Support only one color for all error types</li>
	<li>Does not take into account the probability and/or adapt the color brightness accordingly</li>
	<li>Does not follow the path of error propagation</li>
	<li>Cannot select/filter the display of error flows for a particular error type</li>
</ul>
