<h2>Getting started: instantiate a model</h2>
<p>
Once you have written your AADL model, you may want to instantitate it in order
to analyze your system or just check model correctness. The instance model
represents the architecture from its root component. The root component
is a <strong>system</strong> component, the top-most component in the
hierarchy. It contains all system sub-components.
</p>
<p>
To create the system instance, you need to select the system component
being the root component of the instance model and create the system instance.
To do so, select the text declaration of your system, open
the contextual menu (right click) and select the menu item
 <em>Instantiate system</em> as shown in the following picture.

<p>
Then, a new directory named <em>instances</em> is created
in your project. It contains all instance models. If you open
it, a new file having the <strong>.aaxl</strong> is created, representing
the instance model, as shown in the following picture.

<p>
You now have a complete instantiated system ! You may want to analyze your
system using <a href="../plugins/index.html">OSATE plug-ins</a>, use
third-party tools or try other tools listed on the 
<a href="https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/aadl/" target="blank">AADL wiki</a>.
