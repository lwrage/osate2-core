     <div class="topicTextNotes"><div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>System operation is the execution of a completely instantiated 
and bound system.&#160; System 
operation consists of different phases: </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>System startup: initialization of the execution platform 
and the application system.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Normal operation: execution of threads and communication 
between threads and devices.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>System operation mode transition: mode switching of one 
or more components with specified 
mode transitions.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>System-wide fault handling, shutdown, and restart.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><span><b>System Startup</b></span><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>On system startup, the hardware of the execution platform 
is initialized, the binary images of the 
kernel address space are loaded into memory of each processor, and execution is started to 
initialize the execution platform software.&#160; Loading into memory may take zero time, if the memory 
can be preloaded, e.g., PROM or flash memory.&#160; Once initialized, each processor initiates the 
loading of the binary images of processes bound to the specific processor into memory (see Figure 
17).</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Process binary images are loaded in the memory component 
to which the process and its 
contained software components are bound (see Figure 8).&#160; In a static process loading scenario, 
all 
binary images must be loaded before execution of the application system starts, i.e., thread 
initialization is initiated. In a dynamic process loading scenario, binary images of&#160; all the processes 
that contain a thread that is part of the current mode must be loaded.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The maximum system initialization time can be determined 
as </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>Processor_Startup_Deadline</span></font><font face="Helvetica"><span> 
+ max(</span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>Load_Time</span></font><font face="Helvetica"><span>) 
of all systems and processes + max(</span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>Initialize_Deadline</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span>) of all threads.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>All software components for a process must be bound to 
memory components that are all 
accessible from every processor to which any thread contained in the process is bound.&#160; That is, 
every thread is able to access every memory component into which the binary image of the 
process containing that thread is loaded.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Data components shared across processes must be bound 
to memory accessible by all 
processors to which the processes sharing the data component are bound. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Thread initialization must be completed by the next hyperperiod 
of the initial mode.&#160; Once all 
threads are initialized, threads that are part of the initial mode enter the await dispatch state.&#160;&#160; 
If 
loaded, threads that are not part of the initial mode enter the suspend awaiting mode state (see 
Figure 5). At their first dispatch, the initial values of connected <b>out</b> or <b>in out</b> ports 
are made 
available to destination threads in their <b>in</b> or <b>in out</b> ports.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Helvetica"><span><b>Figure 17 System Instance States, Transitions, and 
Actions</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><span><b>Normal System Operation</b></span><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Normal operation, i.e., the execution semantics of individual 
threads and transfer of data and 
control according to connection and shared access semantics, have been covered in previous 
sections.&#160; In this section we focus on the coordination of such execution semantics throughout 
a 
system instance.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A system instance is called synchronized if all components 
use a globally synchronized reference 
time. A system instance is called asynchronous if different components use separate clocks with 
the potential for clock drift.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>This version of the standard defines the semantics of 
execution for synchronous systems.&#160; A 
method of implementing a system may provide asynchronous system semantics as long as 
system wide coordination protocols are in place.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>In a synchronized system, periodic threads are dispatched 
simultaneously with respect to a global 
clock.&#160; The hyperperiod of a set of periodic threads is defined to be the least common multiple 
of 
the periods of those threads.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>In a synchronized system, a raised event logically arrives 
simultaneously at the ultimate 
destination of all semantic connections whose ultimate source raised the event.&#160; In a synchronized 
system, two events are considered to be raised logically simultaneously if they occur within the 
granularity of the globally synchronized reference time. If several events are logically raised 
simultaneously and arrive at the same port or at different transitions out of the current mode in the 
same or different components, the order of arrival is implementation-dependent. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><span><b>System Operation Modes</b></span><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The set of all mode transitions specified for all components 
of a system instance form a set of 
concurrent mode transitions, called <i>system operation modes</i> (SOM).&#160; The set of possible SOMs 
is 
the cross product of the sets of modes for each component.&#160; That is, a SOM is a set of component 
modes, one mode for each component of the system.&#160; The initial SOM is the set of initial modes 
for each component.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The discrete variable <b>Mode</b> denotes a SOM.&#160; 
That is, the variable <b>Mode</b> denotes a possible 
discrete state that is defined by the mode hybrid semantic diagrams.&#160; Note that the value of <b>Mode</b> 
will in general change at various instants of time during system operation, although not in a 
continuous time-varying way.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The SOM transition is requested whenever a mode transition 
in any component in the system 
instance is requested by the arrival of an event.&#160; A single event can trigger a mode switch request 
in one or more components.&#160; In a synchronized system, this event occurs logically simultaneously 
for all components, i.e., the resulting component mode switch requests are treated as a single 
SOM transition request.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>If several events occur logically simultaneously and 
are semantically connected to transitions in 
different components that lead out of their current mode or to different transitions out of the same 
mode in one component, then events are considered to have an implementation-dependent order 
that determines the mode transition for the mode switch &#150; resulting in the other events being 
ignored. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>After a SOM transition request has occurred, the actual 
SOM transition occurs in zero time, if no 
periodic threads are part of the old mode, otherwise, it occurs at the hyperperiod boundary of the 
old SOM.&#160; This is indicated in Figure 18 by the guard on the transition from the 
</span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>current_system_operation_mode</span></font><font face="Helvetica"><span> 
state to the </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>mode_transition_in_progress</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> state. 
During that time, the system continues to operate in the old SOM and additional events that would 
result in a SOM transition from the current SOM are ignored.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The rational-valued function Hyper(<b>Mode</b>) in Figure 
18 denotes the hyperperiod of a SOM.&#160; The 
hyperperiod is determined by the periods of those periodic threads whose 
</span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>Synchronzied_Component</span></font><font face="Helvetica"><span> 
property is true, and that will deactivate or activate as part of the 
mode switch, or that remain active but whose connections may change during the mode switch.&#160; If 
this set of threads is empty, the mode transition is initiated immediately.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>At the time of actual SOM transition, the transition 
is performed to the new SOM that contains the 
destination modes of the requested component mode switch(es).&#160;&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><span><b>System Operation Mode Transition</b></span><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A runtime transition between SOMs requires a non-zero 
interval of time, during which the system is 
said to be in transition between two system modes of operation. While a system is in transition, 
excluding the instants of time at the start and end of a transition, all arriving events that appear 
in 
transition edge declarations are ignored and will not cause any mode change.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>At the instant of time the mode-transition-in-progress 
state is entered, connections that are part of 
the old SOM and not part of the new SOM are disabled. For data connections, this means that the 
data value is not transferred into the <b>in</b> data port variable of the newly disabled thread.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>At the instant of time the </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>mode-transition-in-progress</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> state is entered, data is transferred 
logically simultaneously for all connections that are declared to be part of any of the component 
mode transitions making up the SOM transition.&#160; For data connections, this means that the data 
is 
transferred from the <b>out</b> data port such that its value becomes available at the first dispatch 
of the 
receiving thread.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>At the instant of time the </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>mode-transition-in-progress 
state</span></font><font face="Helvetica"><span> is entered, connections 
that are not part of the old SOM and part of the new SOM are enabled. For data connections, this 
means that the data value of a transition connection is transferred into the <b>in</b> data port variable 
of 
the newly enabled thread. If the <b>in</b> data port of the destination thread is not the destination 
of a 
transition connection, the data value of the <b>out</b> data port of the source thread is transferred 
into the 
<b>in</b> data port variable of the newly enabled thread.&#160; If the source thread is also activated 
as part of 
the mode transition, its <b>out</b> data port value is transferred after the thread completes its activate 
entrypoint execution.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>When the mode-transition-in-progress state is entered, <i>thread </i><b>exit(Mode)</b> 
is triggered for all 
threads that are part of the old thread and not part of the new thread. This results in the execution 
of deactivation entrypoints for those threads (see Figure 5) as described in Section 11.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>In addition, at the time the </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>mode-transition-in-progress</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> state is entered, <i>thread</i> 
<b>enter(Mode)</b> is triggered for threads that are part of the new mode and not part of the old mode. 
This permits those threads to execute their activation entrypoints (see Figure 5).&#160; In addition, 
for 
periodic threads this is immediately followed by their first compute entrypoint dispatch as 
described in Section 11.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>At the instant of time the </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>mode-transition-in-progress</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> state is entered, connections that 
are not part of the old SOM and are part of the new SOM are enabled, i.e., connection 
transmission occurs according to the connections that are part of the new SOM. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>While the system is in the </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>mode-transition-in-progress</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> state, threads that are part of the 
old and new SOM continue to operate normally.&#160; SOM transition requests as resulting from raise 
events are ignored while the system instance is in the </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>mode-transition-in-progress</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> state.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The system instance remains in the </span></font><font 
face="Courier New"><span>mode-transition-in-progress</span></font><font face="Helvetica"><span> state 
until the next 
hyperperiod.&#160; This hyperperiod is determined by the rules stated earlier. At that time, the system 
instance enters </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>current_system_operation_mode</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> state and starts responding to new 
requests for SOM transition.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="center"><img src="NotesImages/Topic69NotesImage7.jpg" align="bottom" width="527" height="145" border="0" alt="graphic" /></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Helvetica"><span><b>Figure 18 System Mode Switch Semantics</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The synchronization scope for <b>enter(Mode)</b> consists 
of all threads that are contained in the 
system instance that were inactive and are about to become active.&#160; The synchronization scope for 
<b>exit(Mode)</b> contains all threads that are contained in the system instance that were active and 
are 
to become inactive.&#160; The edge labels <b>enter(Mode)</b> and <b>exit(Mode)</b> also appear in the 
set of 
concurrent semantic automata derived from the mode declarations in a specification.&#160; That is, 
<b>enter(Mode)</b> and <b>exit(Mode)</b> transitions for threads occur synchronously with a transition 
from the 
</span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>current_system_operation_mode</span></font><font face="Helvetica"><span> 
state to the </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>mode-transition-in-progress</span></font><font

<div align="left"><span><b>System-wide Fault Handling, Shutdown, and Restart</b></span><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Thread unrecoverable errors result in transmission of 
event data on the Error port of the appropriate 
thread, processor, or device.&#160; The ultimate destination of this semantic connection can be a thread 
or set of threads whose role is that of a system health monitor and system configuration manager. 
Such threads make decisions about appropriate fault handling actions to take.&#160; Such actions 
include raising of events to trigger mode switches, e.g., to request SOM transitions.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Processing Requirements and Permissions</i></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>This standard does not require that source text be associated 
with a software or execution platform 
category.&#160; However, a method of implementing systems may impose this requirement as a 
precondition for constructing a physical system from a specification.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A system instance represents the runtime architecture 
of an application system that is to be 
analyzed and processed.&#160; A system instance is identified to a tool by a component classifier 
reference to an instantiable system implementation.&#160; For example, a tool may allow a system 
classifier reference to be supplied as a command line parameter.&#160; Any such externally identified 
component specification must satisfy all the rules defined in this specification for system instances.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A method of building systems is permitted to only support 
static process loading.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A method of building systems is permitted to create any 
set of loadable binary images that satisfy 
the semantics and legality rules of this standard.&#160; For example, a single load image may be 
created for each processor that contains all processes and threads executed by that processor 
and all source text associated with devices and buses accessible by that processor.&#160; Or a 
separate load image may be created for each process to be loaded into memory to make up the 
process virtual address space, in addition to the kernel address space created for each processor.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A process may define a source namespace for the purpose 
of compiling source programs, define a 
virtual address space, and define a binary image for the purpose of loading.&#160; A method of building 
systems is permitted to separate these functions.&#160; For example, processes may be compiled and 
pre-linked as separate programs, followed by a secondary linking to combine the process binary 
images to form a load image.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A method of building systems is permitted to compile, 
link and load a process as a single source 
program.&#160; That is, a method of building systems is permitted to impose the additional requirement 
that all associated source text for all threads contained in a process form a legal program as 
defined in the applicable programming language standard.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>If two software components that are compiled and linked 
within the same namespace have identical 
component types and implementations, or the intersection of their associated source text 
compilation units is non-empty, then this must be detected and reported.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A method of building systems is permitted to omit loading 
of processor, device, and bus software in 
a processor kernel address space if none of the threads bound to that processor need to access or 
execute that software.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>This standard supports static virtual memory management, 
i.e., permits the construction of 
systems in which binary images of processes are loaded during system initialization, before a 
system begins operation.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Also permitted are methods of dynamic virtual memory 
management or dynamic library linking after 
process loading has completed and thread execution has started.&#160; However, any method for 
implementing a system must assure that all deadline properties will be satisfied for each thread.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>An alternative implementation of the process and thread 
state transition sequences is permitted in 
which a </span></font><font face="Helvetica" color="#010101"><span>process</span></font><font face="Helvetica"><span> 
is loaded and initialized each time the system changes to a mode of operation in 
which any of the containing threads in that </span></font><font face="Helvetica" color="#010101"><span>process</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> are active.&#160; This process load and initialize 
replaces the perform thread activate action in the thread state transition sequence as well as the 
process load action in the process state transition sequence. These alternative semantics may be 
adopted for any designated subset of the </span></font><font face="Helvetica" color="#010101"><span>processes</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> in a system.&#160; All threads contained in a 
process must obey the same thread semantics.</span></font><span></span></div></div>
