<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><b>Introduction</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The SAE Architecture Analysis &amp; Design Language (referred 
to in this document as AADL) is a 
textual and graphical language used to design and analyze the software and hardware architecture 
of performance-critical real-time systems.&#160; These are systems whose operation strongly depends 
on meeting non-functional system requirements such as reliability, availability, timing, 
responsiveness, throughput, safety, and security.&#160; The AADL is used to describe the structure of 
such systems as an assembly of software components mapped onto an execution platform.&#160; It can 
be used to describe functional interfaces to components (such as data inputs and outputs) and 
performance-critical aspects of components (such as timing).&#160; The AADL can also be used to 
describe how components interact, such as how data inputs and outputs are connected or how 
application software components are allocated to execution platform components.&#160; The language 
can also be used to describe the dynamic behavior of the runtime architecture by providing support 
to model operational modes and mode transitions.&#160; The language is designed to be extensible to 
accommodate analyses of the runtime architectures that the core language does not completely 
support.&#160; Extensions can take the form of new properties and analysis specific notations that can 
be associated with components.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The AADL was developed to meet the special needs of performance-critical 
real-time systems, 
including embedded real-time systems such as avionics, automotive electronics, or robotics 
systems.&#160; The language can describe important performance-critical aspects such as timing 
requirements, fault and error behaviors, time and space partitioning, and safety and certification 
properties. Such a description allows a system designer to perform analyses of the composed 
components and systems such as system schedulability, sizing analysis, and safety analysis. 
From these analyses, the designer can evaluate architectural tradeoffs and changes.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Since the AADL supports multiple and extensible analysis 
approaches, it provides the ability to 
analyze the cross cutting impacts of change in the architecture in one specification using a variety 
of analysis tools.&#160; The AADL specification language is designed to be used with analysis tools 
that 
support the automatic generation of the source code needed to integrate the system components 
and build a system executive.&#160; Since the models and the architecture specification drive the design 
and implementation, they can be maintained to permit model driven architecture based changes 
throughout the system lifecycle. </span></font><span></span></div>
