<div align="center"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Semantics</i></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Property associations determine the property value of 
the component instances and their feature, 
connection, flow, and mode instances in the system instance hierarchy (see Section 12.1). The 
property association of a component type, component implementation, subcomponent, feature, 
flow, connection, mode, or subprogram call determines the property value of all instances derived 
from the respective declaration.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>If a property association is declared within a package, 
the property value applies to all component 
classifier declarations contained in the package for which the property is valid.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The value of a property is determined through evaluation 
of the property expression.&#160; Property 
associations are declared in the properties subclause of component types and component 
implementations.&#160; They are also declared as part of feature declarations in component types, as 
part of subcomponent, connection, flow and mode declarations in component implementations. 
Contained property associations declared with subcomponents can represent separate property 
values for different instances of subcomponents, their features, connections, flows and modes that 
are contained in the subcomponent. Contained property associations can also be used to record 
system instance specific property values for all components, features, connections, flows, and 
modes in a system instance. This permits AADL analysis tools to record system instance specific 
information about a physical system separate from the declarative AADL specification.&#160; For 
example, a resource allocation tool can record the actual bindings of threads to processors and 
source text to memory through a set of contained property associations, and can keep multiple 
such binding configurations for the same system.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The property value is determined according to the following 
rules, which impose a precedence on 
the property associations for a particular property.&#160; The earlier a property association for the 
given 
property is encountered by the rules, the higher it&#146;s precedence.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>If a property value is not present after applying all 
of the rules below, it is determined by the default 
value of its property name declaration.&#160; If not present in the property name declaration, the property 
value is undefined.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>For component types and port group types, the property 
value of a property is determined by its 
property association in the properties subclause. If not present, the property value is determined by 
the first ancestor component type or port group type with its property association. If not present 
and the component type or port group type is declared in the private section of a package, then the 
property value is determined by its association in the property subclause of the private section.&#160; 
If 
not present in the private section, it is determined by its association in the property subclause of 
the package&#146;s public section.&#160; If the component type or port group type is declared in the 
public 
section of a package, the property value is determined by its association in the public section of 
the package.&#160; Otherwise, it is considered not present.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>For component implementations and port groups, the property 
value of a property is determined by 
its property association in the properties subclause. If not present, the property value is determined 
by the first ancestor component implementation or port group with its property association. If not 
present, it is determined by the property value of the component implementation&#146;s component type 
according to the component type rules.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>For subcomponents, the property value of a property is 
determined by its property association in 
the subcomponent declaration. If not present and the subcomponent is refined, then the property 
value is determined by a property association in the subcomponent declaration being refined; this 
is done recursively along the refinement sequence. If not present in the subcomponent, it is 
determined by the subcomponent&#146;s component classifier reference according to the respective 
component implementation or component type rules described above.&#160; If not present and the 
property name has been declared as <b>inherit</b>, it is determined by the property value of the 
component implementation that contains the subcomponent declaration according to the 
component implementation rules.&#160; Otherwise, it is considered not present.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>For modes, connections, or flow sequences the property 
value of a property is determined by its 
property association in the mode, connection, or flow sequence declaration. If not present and the 
mode, connection, or flow sequence is refined, then the property value is determined by a property 
association in the mode, connection, or flow sequence declaration being refined; this is done 
recursively along the refinement sequence. If not present and the property name has been declared 
as <b>inherit</b>, it is determined by the property value of the component implementation that contains 
the mode, connection, or flow sequence declaration according to the component implementation 
rules.&#160; Otherwise, it is considered not present.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>For subprogram calls in call sequences, the property 
value of a property is determined by its 
property association in the subprogram call.&#160; If not present and the called subprogram name is 
a 
subprogram classifier reference, the property value is determined by the subprogram classifier 
according to the component implementation or component type rules described above.&#160; If not 
present and the called subprogram name is a subprogram feature reference in a data component, 
the property value is determined by the subprogram feature according to the feature rules described 
below.&#160; If not present and the property name has been declared as <b>inherit</b>, it is determined 
by the 
property value of the component implementation that contains the subprogram call according to the 
compoment implementation rules.&#160; Otherwise, it is considered not present.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>For features in a component type or port group type, 
or flow specifications in a component type, 
the property value of a property is determined by its property association in the feature or flow 
specification declaration. If not present and the feature or flow specification is refined, then the 
property value is determined by a property association in the feature or flow specification 
declaration being refined; this is done recursively along the refinement sequence.&#160; For subprogram, 
server subprogram, and port group features, if not present and the feature references a subprogram 
classifier or port group type reference, the property value is determined by the subprogram 
component classifier reference or port group type according to the respective component 
implementation, component type, or port group type rules described above. If not present and the 
feature references a subprogram feature in a data component type, the property value is determined 
by the subprogram feature according to the feature rules.&#160; If not present and the property name 
has 
been declared as <b>inherit</b>, then it is determined by the property value of the component type or 
port 
group type that contains the feature or flow specification declaration according to the respective 
component type or port group type rules.&#160; Otherwise, it is considered not present.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>For features in a refines type clause of a component 
implementation, the property value of a 
property is determined by its property association in the feature refinement declaration &#160; If not 
present, then the property value is determined by a property association in the feature declaration 
being refined; this is done recursively along the refinement sequence.&#160; If not present and the 
property value has been declared <b>inherit</b>, it is determined by the property value of the component 
implementation according to the component implementation rules.&#160; Otherwise, it is considered not 
present.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>For component, feature, connection, flow, or mode instances 
in the system instance hierarchy, the 
property value of a property is determined by the contained property association highest in the 
system instance hierarchy that references the component, feature, connection, flow, or mode.&#160; If 
not present, then the property value is determined by the respective subcomponent, mode, 
connection, feature declaration that results in the instance according to the rules above.&#160; If 
not 
present and the property name has been declared as <b>inherit</b>, then it is determined by the property 
value of the first containing component in the containment hierarchy of the system instance. 
Otherwise, it is undefined.</span></font><span></span></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Helvetica"><span><b>Figure 16 Property Value Determination</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Figure 16 illustrates the order in which the value of 
a property is determined. Instance4 is an 
element in the system instance hierarchy.&#160; The value of one of its properties is determined by 
first 
looking for a property associated with the instance itself &#150; shown as step 1.&#160; This is specified 
by a 
contained property association. The contained property association for this instance declared in a 
component implementation highest in the instance hierarchy determines that value.&#160; If no instance 
value exists, the implementation (ImplA) of the instance is examined (step 2).&#160; If it does not 
exist, 
ancestor implementations are examined (step 3).&#160; If the property value still has not been 
determined, the component type is examined (step 4).&#160; If not found there, its ancestor component 
types are examined (step 5).&#160; If not found and the property is inherited, for subcomponents and 
features, the enclosing implementation is examined.&#160; Otherwise, the containing component in the 
component instance hierarchy is examined (step 6).&#160; Finally, the default value is considered.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Two property association operators are supported.&#160; 
The operator <b>=&gt;</b> results in a new value for the 
property.&#160; The operator <b>+=&gt;</b> results in the addition of a value to a property value list.&#160; 
More 
specifically, a property association via the operator <b>=&gt;</b> replaces any associations of lower 
precedence according to the above rules.&#160; A property association via the operator <b>+=&gt;</b> 
appends to 
the value determined by the association immediately preceding it according to the order imposed 
by the above rules.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A property value list is evaluated by evaluating each 
of the property expressions, and appending the 
values in order.&#160; If the property expression evaluates to a list, all the list elements are appended.&#160; 
If 
the property expression evaluates to undefined, it is treated as an empty list.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>If a property association is declared with the reserved 
word <b>constant</b>, then the following rules 
apply: </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>For subcomponents, connections, flow sequences, and modes, 
any refinements cannot contain a 
property association for this property.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>For features or flow specifications, any refinements 
cannot contain a property association for this 
property.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>For component implementations, any component implementation 
extension, or any 
subcomponents referencing the component implementation or any of its descendents as 
component classifier cannot contain a property association for this property.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>For port groups, any port group refinement cannot contain 
a property association for this property.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>For component types, any component type extension, any 
component implementation, any 
subcomponent, or any subprogram or server subprogram feature referencing the component type or 
any of its descendents cannot contain a property association for this property.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>For port group types, any port group type extension or 
any port group feature referencing the port 
group type or any its descendents cannot contain a property association for this property.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A property association declared with the reserved word <b>access</b> 
applies to the access to an actual 
subcomponent represented by the provided or required subcomponent access rather than the 
actual subcomponent itself.&#160; Two different components sharing access to a component may have 
different access property associations.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The optional </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>in_modes</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> subclause specifies what modes the property association is part of.&#160; The 
detailed semantics of this subclause are defined in Section 11.1.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Component instance property associations with specified 
contained subcomponent identifier 
sequences allow separate property values to be associated with each component instance in the 
containment hierarchy. In particular, it permits separate property values such as actual processor 
binding property values or result values from an analysis method to be associated with each 
component in the system instance containment hierarchy.</span></font><span></span></div></div>
