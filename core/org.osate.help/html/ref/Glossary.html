Connections may be bound to buses.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Component</i>: [AADL] A <i>component</i> is a hardware, 
software, or system unit used as a part of some

<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Component Type</i>: [AADL] A <i>component type</i> 
is a kind of <i>component classifier</i> that describes a 
component&#146;s visible functional and behavioral interface.&#160; The <i>component type</i> describes 
the 
provided features and accessible components of an instance of the type that other components

devices are sensors and actuators that interface with the external physical world, or standalone 
systems such as a GPS that can interface with an application system.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Dispatch Point</i>: [AADL] For periodic threads: any 
non-negative integral multiple of the period 
following the transition out of the </span></font><font face="Helvetica" color="#010101"><span>loaded 
process</span></font><font face="Helvetica"><span> state.&#160; For sporadic and aperiodic threads:&#160;

arrival of an event or event data at an event or event data port of the thread, or the arrival of a 
remote 
subprogram call at a server subprogram feature of the thread following the transition out of the 
</span></font><font face="Helvetica" color="#010101"><span>loaded process</span></font><font face="Helvetica"><span> 
state.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Error</i>: [IFIP, AADL] An <i>error </i>in a physical 
component occurs when an existing fault causes the 
internal state of the component to deviate from its nominal or desired operation.&#160; For example, 
a 
component error may occur when an add instruction produces an incorrect result because a 
transistor in the adding circuitry is faulty.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Error Latency</i>: [AADL] The period of time a component 
may persist in an erroneous state before a

is detected, either by the component itself or by another component with which it interfaces.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Execution Platform</i>: [AADL] A combination of hardware 
and software that supports the execution of 
application software through its ability to schedule threads, store source text code and data, and 
perform communication modeled by connections.&#160; This combination would typically include runtime

<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Execution Platform Component</i>: [AADL] A component 
of the execution platform.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Failure</i>: [IFIP, AADL] A <i>failure</i> in a physical 
component occurs when an error manifests itself at the 
component interface.&#160; A component fails when it does not perform its nominal function for the other 
parts of the system that depend on that component for their nominal operation.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Fault</i>:<i> </i>[IFIP, AADL] A fault is defined 
to be an anomalous undesired change in thread execution 
behavior, possibly resulting from an anomalous undesired change in data being accessed by that 
thread or from violation of a compute time or deadline constraint.&#160; A <i>fault</i> in a physical 
component 
is a root cause that may eventually lead to a component error or failure.&#160; A fault is often a specific 
event such as a transistor burning out or a programmer making a coding mistake.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Fault Latency</i>: [AADL] The period of time before 
a component may persist in a faulty state before 
an error occurs.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Feature: </i>[AADL] A <i>feature</i> models a characteristic 
or a component that is externally visible as part 
of the component type. A feature is used to establish interaction with other components.&#160; Features 
include: ports and port groups to support flow of data and control, access to data components and 
bus components to support coordination of access to shared data components, subprograms to 
represent entry points, and parameters to represent the data values that can be passed into and 
out of subprograms.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Immediate Connection</i>: [AADL]&#160; A connection 
between two data ports, where the execution of the 
receiving thread is delayed until the sending thread completes execution and data is transferred at 
that time.&#160; This results in deterministic communication of state data and receipt of data in mid- 
frame, i.e., within the same dispatch of both the sending and receiving thread.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Implementation</i>: [IEEE] The result of translating 
a design, i.e., architecture, components,

in (2). [UML] A named set of operations that characterize the behavior of an element. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Memory</i>: [AADL] A <i>memory</i> is a category of 
component used to model randomly addressable 
physical storage or logical storage.&#160; A memory component may be contained in a platform, or may 
be accessible from a platform via a bus.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Mode</i>: [AADL] A <i>mode </i>models an operational 
mode in the form of an alternative set of active 
threads and connections and alternative execution behavior within threads.&#160; A mode behavior 
models dynamic mode changes by declaring runtime transitions between operational modes as the 
result of events. Mode specifications can be hierarchical; sub-moding and concurrent 
reconfiguration of different subsystems can be specified.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Model</i>: [UML] An abstraction of a physical system, 
with a certain purpose.</span></font><span></span></div>

program as defined by the applicable programming language standard.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Property</i>: [AADL] A <i>property</i> is a named 
value associated with an AADL component, connection,
