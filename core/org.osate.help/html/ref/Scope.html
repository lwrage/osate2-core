     <div class="topicTextNotes"><div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>This standard defines a language for describing both 
the software architecture and the execution 
platform architectures of performance-critical, embedded, real-time systems; the language is 
known as the SAE Architecture Analysis &amp; Design Language (AADL).&#160; An architecture model 
defined in AADL describes the properties and interfaces of components.&#160; Components fall into two 
major categories:&#160; those that represent the execution platform and those representing the 
application.&#160; The former is typified by processors, buses, and memory, the latter by application 
software modules.&#160; The model describes how these components interact and are integrated to form 
complete systems.&#160; It describes both functional interfaces and aspects critical for performance 
of 
individual components and assemblies of components.&#160; The changes to the runtime architecture 
are modeled as operational modes and mode transitions. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The language is applicable to systems that are:</span></font><span></span></div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">

those that may include specialized device hardware.&#160; </span></font><span></span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>This standard defines the core AADL that is designed 
to be extensible.&#160; While the core language 
provides a number of modeling concepts with precise semantics including the mapping to 
execution platforms and the specification of execution time behavior, it is not possible to foresee 
all 
possible architecture analyses.&#160; Extensions to accommodate new analyses and unique hardware 
attributes take the form of new properties and analysis specific notations that can be associated 
with components.&#160; Users or tool vendors may define extension sets.&#160; Extension sets may be 
proposed for inclusion in this standard.&#160; Such extensions will be defined as part of a new Annex 
appended to the standard.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>This standard does not specify how the detailed design 
or implementation details of software and 
hardware components are to be specified.&#160; Those details can be specified by a variety of software 
programming and hardware description languages.&#160; The standard specifies relevant characteristics 
of the detailed design and implementation descriptions, such as source text written in a 
programming language or hardware description language, from an external (black box) perspective. 
These relevant characteristics are specified as AADL component properties, and as rules of 
conformance between the properties and the described components.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>This standard does not prescribe any particular system 
integration technologies, such as operating 
system or middleware application program interfaces or bus technologies or topologies.&#160; However, 
specific system architecture topologies, such as the ARINC 653 RTOS, can be modeled through 
software and execution platform components.&#160; The AADL can be used to describe a variety of 
hardware architectures and software infrastructures.&#160; Integration technologies can be used to 
implement a specified system.&#160; The standard specifies rules of conformance between AADL 
system architecture specifications and physical systems implemented from those specifications.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The standard was not designed around a particular set 
of tools.&#160; It is anticipated that systems and 
software tools will be provided to support the use of the AADL.</span></font><span></span></div></div>

     <div class="topicTextNotes"><div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The purpose of the AADL is to provide a standard and 
sufficiently precise (machine-processable) 
way of modeling the architecture of an embedded, real-time system, such as an avionics system or 
automotive control system, to permit analysis of its properties, and to support the predictable 
integration of its implementation.&#160; Defining a standard way to describe system components, 
interfaces, and assemblies of components facilitates the exchange of engineering data between the 
multiple organizations and technical disciplines that are invariably involved in an embedded real- 
time system development effort.&#160; A precise and machine-processable way to describe conceptual 
and runtime architectures provides a framework for system modeling and analysis; facilitates the 
automation of code generation, system build, and other development activities; and significantly 
reduces design and implementation defects.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The AADL describes application software and execution 
platform components of a system, and the 
way in which components are assembled to form a complete system or subsystem.&#160; The language 
addresses the needs of system developers in that it can describe common functional (control and 
data flow) interfacing idioms as well as performance-critical aspects relating to timing, resource 
allocation, fault-tolerance, safety and certification.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The AADL describes functional interfaces and non-functional 
properties of application software and 
execution platform components.&#160; The language is not suited for detailed design or implementation 
of components. AADL may be used in conjunction with existing standard languages in these 
areas.&#160; The AADL describes interfaces and properties of execution platform components including 
processor, memory, communication channels, and devices interfacing with the external 
environment.&#160; Detailed designs for such hardware components may be specified by associating 
source text written in a hardware description language such as VHDL.&#160; The AADL can describe 
interfaces and properties of application software components implemented in source text, such as 
threads, processes, and runtime configurations.&#160; Detailed designs and implementations of 
algorithms for such components may be specified by associating source text written in a software 
programming language such as Ada 95 or C, or domain-specific modeling languages such as 
MatLab<sup>&#174;</sup>/Simulink<sup>&#174;</sup>.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The AADL describes how components are composed together 
and how they interact to form 
complete system architectures.&#160; Runtime semantics of these components are specified in this 
standard.&#160; Various mechanisms are available to exchange control and data between components, 
including message passing, event passing, synchronized access to shared components, and 
remote procedure calls.&#160; Thread scheduling protocols and timing requirements may be specified. 
Dynamic reconfiguration of the runtime architecture may be specified through operational modes 
and mode transitions.&#160; The language does not require the use of any specific hardware architecture 
or any specific runtime software infrastructure. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Rules of conformance are specified between specifications 
written in the AADL, source text and 
physical components described by those specifications, and physical systems constructed from 
those specifications.&#160; The AADL is not intended to describe all possible aspects of any possible 
component or system; selected syntactic and semantic requirements are imposed on components 
and systems.&#160; Many of the attributes of an AADL component are represented in an AADL model as 
properties of that component.&#160; The conformance rules of the language include the characteristics 
described by these properties as well as the syntactic and semantic requirements imposed on 
components and systems.&#160; Compliance between AADL specifications and items described by 
specifications is determined through analysis, e.g., by tools for source text processing and system 
integration.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The AADL can be used for multiple activities in multiple 
development phases, beginning with 
preliminary system design.&#160; The language can be used by multiple tools to automate various levels 
of modeling, analysis, implementation, integration, verification and certification.</span></font><span></span></div></div>

     <div class="topicTextNotes"><div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The AADL can be used to specify dependable systems.&#160; 
A system can be compliant with its 
specification and this standard even when that system contains failed components that no longer 
satisfy their specifications.&#160; This section defines the terms fault, error, exception, anomaly 
and 
noncompliance [IFIP WG10.4-1992]; and defines how those terms apply to AADL specifications, 
physical components (implementations), models of components, and tools that accept AADL 
specifications as inputs.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A <i>fault</i> is defined to be an anomalous undesired 
change in thread execution behavior, possibly 
resulting from an anomalous undesired change in data being accessed by that thread or from 
violation of a compute time or deadline constraint.&#160; A fault in a physical component is a root 
cause 
that may eventually lead to a component error or failure.&#160; A fault is often a specific event such 
as a 
transistor burning out or a programmer making a coding mistake.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>An <i>error </i>in a physical component occurs when an 
existing fault causes the internal state of the 
component to deviate from its nominal or desired operation.&#160; For example, a component error may 
occur when an add instruction produces an incorrect result because a transistor in the adding 
circuitry is faulty.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A <i>failure</i> in a physical component occurs when 
an error manifests itself at the component interface. 
&#160;A component fails when it does not perform its nominal function for the other parts of the system 
that depend on that component for their nominal operation.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A component failure may be a fault within a system that 
contains that component.&#160; Thus, the 
sequence of fault, error, failure may repeat itself within a hierarchically structured system.&#160; <i>Error 
propagation</i> occurs when a failed component causes the containing system or another dependent 
component to become erroneous.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A component may persist in a faulty state for some period 
of time before an error occurs. This is 
called <i>fault latency</i>.&#160; A component may persist in an erroneous state for some period of 
time before 
a failure occurs. This is called <i>error latency</i>.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>An <i>exception</i> represents a kind of exceptional 
situation; it may occur for an erroneous or failed 
component when that error or failure is detected, either by the component itself or another 
component with which it interfaces.&#160; For example, a fault in a software component that eventually 
results in a divide-by-zero may be detected by the processor component on which it depends.&#160; An 
exception is always associated with a specific component.&#160; This document defines a standard 
model for exceptions for certain kinds of components (e.g. defines standard recovery sequences 
and standard exception events).</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>An <i>anomaly</i> occurs when a component is in an erroneous 
or failed state that does not result in a 
standard exception.&#160; Undetected errors may occur in systems.&#160; A detected error may be handled 
using mechanisms other than the standard exception mechanisms.&#160; For example, an error may 
propagate to multiple components before it is detected and mitigated.&#160; This standard defines 
nominal and exceptional behaviors for components.&#160; Anomalies are any other undefined erroneous 
component behaviors, which are nevertheless considered compliant with this standard.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>An AADL specification is <i>compliant</i> with this standard 
if it satisfies all the syntactic and legality 
rules defined herein.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A component or system is <i>compliant</i> with an AADL 
specification of that component or system if 
the nominal and exceptional behaviors of that component or system satisfy the applicable 
semantics of the AADL specification, as defined by the semantic rules in this standard.&#160; A 
component or system may be a physical implementation (e.g. a piece of hardware), or may be a 
model (e.g. a simulation or analytic model).&#160; A model component or system may exhibit only 
partial semantics (e.g. a schedulability model only exhibits temporal semantics).&#160; Physical 
components and systems must exhibit all specified semantics, except as permitted by this 
standard.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>Noncompliance</i> of a component with its specification 
is a kind of design fault. This may be handled 
by run-time fault-tolerance in an implemented physical system.&#160; A developer is permitted to 
classify such components as anomalous rather than noncompliant.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A tool that operates on AADL specifications is <i>compliant</i> 
with this standard if the tool checks for 
compliance of input specifications with the syntactic and legality rules defined herein, except where 
explicit permission is given to omit a check; and if all physical or model components or systems 
generated by the tool are compliant with the specifications used to generate those components or 
systems.&#160; The AADL standard allows profiles of language subsets to be defined and requires a 
minimum subset of the language to be supported (see Appendix B.1).&#160;&#160; A tool must clearly specify 
any portion of the language not supported and warn the user if a specification contains unsupported 
language constructs, when appropriate.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Compliance of an AADL specification with the syntactic 
and legality rules can be automatically 
checked, with the exception of a few legality rules that are not in general tractably checkable for 
all 
specifications.&#160; Compliance of a component or system with its specification, and compliance of 
a 
tool with this standard, cannot in general be fully automatically checked.&#160; A verification process 
that assures compliance to the degree required for a particular purpose must be used to perform 
the latter two kinds of compliance checking.</span></font><span></span></div></div>

     <div class="topicTextNotes"><div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Discrete and temporal semantics of the language are defined 
in sections that define AADL 
concepts using a concurrent hierarchical hybrid automata notation, together with additional 
narrative rules about those diagrams.&#160; This notation consists of a hierarchical finite state machine 
notation, augmented with real-valued variables to denote time and time-varying values, and with 
edge guard and state invariant predicates over those variables to define temporal constraints on 
when discrete state transitions may occur.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A semantic diagram defines the nominal scheduling and 
reconfiguration behavior for a modeled 
system as well as scheduling and reconfiguration behavior when failures are detected.&#160; A physical 
realization of a specification may violate this definition, for example due to runtime errors.&#160; 
A 
violation of the defined semantics is called an anomalous behavior.&#160; Certain kinds of anomalous 
behaviors are permitted by this standard.&#160; Legal anomalous behaviors are defined in the narrative 
rules.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Semantics for individual components are defined using 
a sequential hierarchical hybrid automaton. 
System semantics are defined as the concurrent composition of the hybrid automata of the system 
components.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Ovals labeled with lower case phrases are used to denote 
discrete states.&#160; A component may 
remain in one of its discrete states for an interval of time whose duration may be zero or greater. 
Every semantic automaton for a component has a unique initial discrete state, indicated by a heavy 
border.&#160; For example,</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="center"><img src="NotesImages/Topic14NotesImage2.jpg" align="bottom" width="502" height="65" border="0" alt="graphic" /></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Directed edges labeled with one or more comma-separated, 
lower case phrases are used to denote 
possible transitions between the discrete states of a component.&#160; Transitions over an edge are 
logically instantaneous, i.e., the time interval in which a transition from a discrete state (called 
the 
source discrete state) to a discrete state (called the destination discrete state) has duration 0. 
During the instant of time in which a transition occurs, it is undefined whether the component is in 
the source state or the destination state. For example,</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="center"><img src="NotesImages/Topic14NotesImage3.jpg" align="bottom" width="502" height="56" border="0" alt="graphic" /></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Permissions that allow a runtime implementation of a 
transition to occur over an interval of time are 
expressed as narrative rules. However, all implemented transitions must be atomic with respect to 
each other, all observable serializations must be admitted by the logical semantics, and all 
temporal predicates as defined in subsequent paragraphs must be satisfied. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Oblong boxes labeled with lower case phrases denote abstract 
discrete states that are defined as 
sets of other discrete states and edges.&#160; Wherever such an abstract discrete state appears in a 
hybrid semantics diagram, there will always be another hybrid semantics diagram showing an 
identically labeled oblong box that contains discrete states and edges to define that abstract 
discrete state.&#160; For example,</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="center"><img src="NotesImages/Topic14NotesImage4.jpg" align="bottom" width="535" height="199" border="0" alt="graphic" /></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>If there are multiple oblong boxes with the same label 
in a diagram, then multiple abstract discrete 
states are denoted.&#160; That is, the behavior is as if every occurrence of an abstract discrete state 
were replaced by a copy of its defining set of discrete states and transitions.&#160; In this standard, 
abstract states and edges that connect them will always be labeled so that the defining diagram for 
an abstract state, and the association between edges in the defining diagram and edges in the 
containing diagram, are unambiguous.&#160; An abstract state label or an edge label may include 
italicized letters that are not a part of the formal name but are used to distinguish multiple 
instances.&#160; For example, both abstract discrete states below will be defined by a single diagram 
labeled </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>executing</span></font><font face="Helvetica"><span>.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="center"><img src="NotesImages/Topic14NotesImage6.jpg" align="bottom" width="373" height="243" border="0" alt="graphic" /></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>If there is an external edge that enters or exits the 
containing oblong box in the defining diagram for 
an abstract state, and there are no edges within that definition that connect any internal discrete 
state with that external edge, then there implicitly exist edges from every contained discrete state 
in the defining diagram to or from that external edge.&#160; That is, a transition over that external 
edge 
may occur for any discrete state in the defining diagram.&#160; For example, in the following diagram 
there is an implicitly defined </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>halt</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> edge out of both the </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>ready</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> and the </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>running</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> discrete states.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="center"><img src="NotesImages/Topic14NotesImage7.jpg" align="bottom" width="333" height="209" border="0" alt="graphic" /></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Real-valued variables whose values are time-varying may 
appear in expressions that annotate 
discrete states and edges of hybrid semantic diagrams.&#160; Specific forms of annotation are defined 
in 
subsequent paragraphs.&#160; The set of real-valued variables associated with a semantic diagram are 
those that appear in any expression in that diagram, or in any of the defining diagrams for abstract 
discrete states that appear in that diagram.&#160; Real-valued time-varying variables will be named 
using 
an italicized front.&#160; The initial values for the real-valued time-varying variables of a hybrid 
semantic 
diagram are undefined whenever they are not explicitly defined in narrative rules.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>In addition to standard rational literals and arithmetic 
operators, expressions may also contain 
functions of discrete variables.&#160; The names of functions and discrete variables will begin with 
upper 
case letters.&#160; The semantics for function symbols and discrete variables will be defined using 
narrative rules.&#160; For example, the subexpression </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>Max(Compute_Time)</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> may appear in a semantic 
diagram, together with a narrative rule stating that the value is the maximum value of a range-valued 
component property named </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>Compute_Time</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span>.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Edges may be annotated with assignments of values to 
variables associated with the semantic 
diagram.&#160; When a transition occurs over an edge, the values of the variables are set to the 
assigned values.&#160; For example, in the following diagram, the values of the variables <i>c</i> and <i>t</i> 
are set 
to 0 when the component transitions into the </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>ready</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> discrete state.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="center"><img src="NotesImages/Topic14NotesImage9.jpg" align="bottom" width="145" height="110" border="0" alt="graphic" /></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Discrete states may be annotated with expressions that 
define the possible rates of change for real-
&#160;valued variables during the duration of time a component is in that discrete state.&#160; The 
rate of a 
variable is denoted using the symbol </span></font><font face="Courier New Greek"><span>&#948;</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span>, for example </span></font><font face="Courier New Greek"><span>&#948;</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span><i>x</i>=[0,1] (the rate of the variable <i>x</i> may be any 
real value in the range of 0 to 1).&#160; If, rates of change are not explicitly shown within a discrete 
state 
for a time-varying variable, then the rate of change of that variable in that state is defined to be 
1. 
For example, in the following diagram the rate of change for the variable <i>c</i> is 1 while the component 
is in the discrete state </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>running</span></font><font face="Helvetica"><span>, 
but its value remains fixed while the component is in the </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>ready</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> 
state, equal to the value that existed when the component transitioned into the </span></font><font 
face="Courier New"><span>ready</span></font><font face="Helvetica"><span> state.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="center"><img src="NotesImages/Topic14NotesImage12.jpg" align="bottom" width="171" height="143" border="0" alt="graphic" /></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A discrete state may be annotated with Boolean-valued 
expressions called invariants of that 
discrete state.&#160; In this standard, all semantic diagrams are defined so that the values of the 
variables will always satisfy the invariants of a discrete state for every possible transition into 
that 
discrete state.&#160; A transition must occur out of a discrete state before the values of any time-varying 
variables cause any invariant of that discrete state to become false.&#160; Invariants are used to define 
bounds on the duration of time that a component can remain in a discrete state.&#160; For example, in 
the following diagram the component must transition out of the </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>running</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> state before the value of 
the variable <i>c</i> exceeds 10.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="center"><img src="NotesImages/Topic14NotesImage13.jpg" align="bottom" width="158" height="140" border="0" alt="graphic" /></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>An edge may be annotated with Boolean-valued expressions 
called guards of that edge.&#160; A 
transition may occur from a source discrete state to a destination discrete state only when the 
values of the variables satisfy all guards for an edge between those discrete states. A guard on an 
edge is evaluated before any assignments on that edge are performed.&#160; For example, in the 
following diagram the component may only </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>complete</span></font><font 
face="Helvetica"><span> when the value of the variable <i>c</i> is 5 or 
greater (but must </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>complete</span></font><font face="Helvetica"><span> 
before <i>c</i> exceeds 10 because of the invariant).</span></font><span></span></div>

<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A sequential semantic automaton defines semantics for 
a single component. A system may 
contain multiple components.&#160; The semantics of a system are defined to be the concurrent 
composition of the sequential semantic automata for each component.&#160; Except as described 
below, every component is represented by a copy of its defined semantic automaton. All discrete 
states and labels, all edges and labels, and all variables, are local to a component. The set of 
discrete states of the system is the cross-product of the sets of discrete states for each of its 
cross product components.&#160; The set of transitions that may occur for a system at any point in time 
is the union of the transitions that may occur at that instant for any of its components.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>If an edge label appears in boldface, then a transition 
may occur over that edge only when a 
transition occurs over all edges having that same boldface label within the synchronization scope 
for that label. The synchronization scope for a boldface label is indicated in parentheses.&#160; For 
example, if a transition occurs over an edge having a boldface label with a synchronization scope of 
process, then every thread contained in that process in which that boldface label appears anywhere 
in its hybrid semantic diagram must transition over some edge having that label. That is, transitions 
over edges with boldface labels occur synchronously with all similarly labeled edge transitions in all 
components associated with the component with the specified synchronization scope as described 
in the narrative.&#160; Furthermore, every component in that synchronization scope that might participate 
in such a transition in any of its discrete states must be in one of those discrete states and 
participate in that transition.&#160; For example, when the synchronization scope for the edge label <b>s</b> 
is 
the same for all three of the following concurrent semantic automata, a transition over the edge 
labeled <b>s</b> may only occur when all three components are in their discrete states labeled </span></font><font 
face="Courier New"><span>a,</span></font><font face="Helvetica"><span> and all 
three components simultaneously transition to their discrete states labeled </span></font><font face="Courier New"><span>c</span></font><font

<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>If a variable appears in boldface, then there is a single 
instance of that variable that is shared by all 
components in the synchronization scope of the variable.&#160; The synchronization scope for a boldface 
variable will be defined in narrative rules.</span></font><span></span></div></div>
